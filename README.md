# LautaroInterGoalsAnalysis
Analysing goals scored by soccer players by both club and national team.

The datasets have the following columns:
1. Competition
2. Round
3. Date
4. H/A - Home or Away
5. Club/Team
6. Against
7. Final Score
8. Position
9. Minute
10. Which goal
11. How was it scored
12. Assist

I added charts to represent the Breakdown of goals by:
- Competition
- The way the goal was scored
- Where it was scored (home or away)
- Opponent
- Year
- Month
- Half (first or second)
- Assist from

Also, there's a heatmap that shows the correlation between years and months in which the goals were scored in.

Now I'm working on adding a Bar Chart Animation to this project.
